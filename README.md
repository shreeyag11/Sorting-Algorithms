Comparison-based Sorting Algorithms

The various sorting algorithm used in the comparison are:
1. Insertion sort
2. Merge sort
3. Heapsort [vector based, and inserting one item at a time]
4. In-place quicksort (any random item or the first or the last item of your input can be pivot).
5. Modified quicksort
  a. Use median-of-three as pivot.
  b. For small sub-problem of size LaTeX: \le10â‰¤ 10,  use insertion sort.

This file provides steps to execute the sorting algorithms:

Default input arrays of sizes : [1000,2000,3000,4000,5000,10000,20000,30000,40000,50000]


To execute Random Array sort run file "randomArray.py"
To execute Sorted Array sort run file "sortedArray.py"
To execute Reverse Array sort run file "reverseArray.py"

Output: Execution Time in milliseconds for each size of array seperated by comma(,) and plotted graph between milliseconds and input size.
